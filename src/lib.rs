//! RPPAL provides access to the Raspberry Pi's GPIO, I2C, PWM, SPI and UART
//! peripherals through a user-friendly interface. In addition to peripheral
//! access, RPPAL also offers support for USB to serial adapters.
//!
//! The library can be used in conjunction with a variety of platform-agnostic
//! drivers through its `embedded-hal` trait implementations. Both `embedded-hal`
//! v0.2.7 and v1 are supported.
//!
//! RPPAL requires Raspberry Pi OS or any similar, recent, Linux distribution.
//! Both `gnu` and `musl` libc targets are supported. RPPAL is compatible with the
//! Raspberry Pi A, A+, B, B+, 2B, 3A+, 3B, 3B+, 4B, 5, CM, CM 3, CM 3+, CM 4, 400,
//! Zero, Zero W and Zero 2 W. Backwards compatibility for minor revisions isn't
//! guaranteed until v1.
